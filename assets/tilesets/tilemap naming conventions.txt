The colour of a pixel on the tilemap provides instructions as to
how it should look in-game.

The RGBA value of each pixel is used for this as follows:

R: the room tileset it should draw from.
G: nothing.
B: the type of tile within the tileset.
A: scratchpad, for runtime use only.


Pure black (0,0,0) is disallowed for rooms, as it indicates space that is extraneous to the game.
